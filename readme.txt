# to keep the version of a token and we can increment
this version and that will invalidate all the old tokens:
add new field to entity/User.ts=> whenever we create refreshToken we pass current version
=> auth.ts:createrefreshtoken => userresolver.ts:revoke the token for somebody 
(we expose that for testing purposes becase it will be the simplest way: actually we don't make
mutation like this but instead we do create function that we can call when somebody forget password
or we can internally use this owns account when they gets hacked)
